            <p>I worked on some <span>HTML & CSS</span>, <span>C#</span>, and <span>SQL</span></span> projects during the first and second semesters of the Software engineering technician Program.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Unfortunately, I don't have access to all those project files as I was not using a version control system for all the projects. However, below is a link to a sample webpage I created to test the web server and a git repository with some of my semester one web projects.</p>
